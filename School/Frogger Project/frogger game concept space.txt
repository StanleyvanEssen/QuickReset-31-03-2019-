frog = spaceman
road = you begin with a jetpack (like they use in space :p) and once you get to the second grass patch it dies for some reason
cars = ufo's
grass = idk
turtles = astroids or some other thing that idk about rn
trees = astroids or some other thing that idk about rn
water = blackhole(s)
sides of the screen = portals (like ricks portal gun or from portal but not how they work from portal cause that would make no sense at all here, only the teleporting aspect)
end point thingy = space dust/ cosmic dust and once you collect it you get teleported to the beginning

why this? i abolutely adore space and i will make it unique by idk i guess using my own kinda art style
